# Mapping The Spirit

An archival storytelling project that charts the religious and spiritual articulations of people of African descent in North America. This interdisciplinary project spans the mediums of photography, audio, and text with a focus on carving out space to elaborate on the religious and spiritual depth beyond the reductions of our community to “the Black Church.”
